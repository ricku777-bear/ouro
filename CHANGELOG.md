## [0.2.4] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- Cache-safe forking for memory compaction — compaction reuses the main conversation's prefix for prompt cache hits, reducing compaction cost by ~90% (#117)
- Run-scoped `reasoning_effort` control via CLI (`--reasoning-effort`) and interactive `/reasoning` menu (#105)
- LLM cache token tracking & display with cache read/write breakdown in statistics panel (#106)
- Parallel execution for same-turn readonly tool calls via `asyncio.TaskGroup` (#103)
- `--verify` CLI flag to explicitly enable Ralph Loop self-verification in `--task` mode (#98)
- ChatGPT OAuth PKCE login with browser-based auth flow and manual paste fallback (#111)
- OAuth provider picker login/logout for ChatGPT/Codex with catalog-sync model list (#92)
- Token counting accuracy improvement with `litellm.token_counter`, fixing 40–57% underestimation for CJK text (#108)
- Support installing ouro from git branch in Harbor (`AGENT_BRANCH` config) (#95)

### Changed

- Simplify tool design: 12 → 10 tools — merged `explore_context` + `parallel_execute` into `multi_task` with DAG-based dependency scheduling, removed background shell mechanism (#100)
- Improve `multi_task` dependency semantics: structured sub-agent results (`SUMMARY` / `KEY_FINDINGS` / `ERRORS`), strict dependency satisfaction (#113)
- Improve slash autocomplete engine with fuzzy ranking, boundary bonus, and gap penalty (#97)
- `--task` mode no longer runs Ralph Loop by default (use `--verify` to enable) (#98)

### Fixed

- TUI: single-line spinner to eliminate ghost `╭─ Thinking ─╮` artifacts left by Rich's multi-line `Live(transient=True)` (#118)
- TUI: correct spinner titles and messages across agent lifecycle (was hardcoded to "Thinking") (#116)
- Pin ouro version in `harbor-run.sh` to prevent container version drift (#94)

## [0.2.3] - 2026-02-14

### Added

- Harbor installed agent integration for containerized evaluation (e.g. Terminal-Bench 2.0) with Jinja2 install script and auto-generated `models.yaml`
- `harbor-run.sh` convenience script with proxy/env configuration
- Python 3.13+ support by migrating from `tree-sitter-languages` to individual language packages with `abi3` wheels
- 47 unit tests for code structure tool covering all 9 supported languages

### Changed

- Reorder system prompt sections for improved structure (`workflow` and `tool_usage_guidelines` before `agents_md`)
- Disable long-term memory by default (set `LONG_TERM_MEMORY_ENABLED=true` in `~/.ouro/config` to enable)
- Remove redundant `<critical_rules>` section from agent system prompt
- Update to tree-sitter 0.25 API (`Query()` constructor + `QueryCursor.captures()`)
- Harden `install-ouro.sh.j2` with `pipefail`, increased retry count/delay, and post-install verification

### Fixed

- Harbor Docker proxy support: rewrite `127.0.0.1` → `host.docker.internal` for container networking
- Add retry logic for network-dependent commands in Harbor install (`apt-get`, `curl`, `uv`)
- Fix `harbor-run.sh` timeout flag (`--timeout-multiplier`) and default dataset (`terminal-bench-sample@2.0`)
- Fix Kotlin grammar query patterns (`simple_identifier`/`type_identifier` → `identifier`)

## [0.2.2] - 2026-02-08

### Fixed
